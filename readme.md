# Docker + Node "Hello World" Example

This repository gives you a quick introduction to getting docker running with Node. It is intended for the Docker beginner.

You can adapt the same approach to other languages but I chose Node because it's what I use most often.


## Setup

First, checkout this project locally and then follow these steps:

0. Go through the Docker [installation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and [getting started guide](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/) before you start.
1. Install the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox).
2. Start a "Quickstart Terminal" session (see the getting started guide).
3. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t hello-world .`
4. Run the image in a container: `docker run -d -p 4001:4000 hello-world`
  - The `-d` flag says to run the container in the background (daemon mode).
  - The `-p` flag maps port 4000 from the container to port 4001 on the docker machine.
5. View your new container: `docker ps`
6. Check the logs for your container: `docker logs <container-id>`
7. Check the port of the container: `docker port <container-id>`
8. Open the app running on the docker machine: `open http://$(docker-machine ip default):4001`



## Notes & Tips

- If you make changes to your application, you will need to rebuild your image and restart your container.
- The `docker-machine` command controls the virtual machine that is running Docker on your machine.
- View logs for a docker container: `docker logs <container-id>`
- List all running containers: `docker ps -a`
  - List running containers: `docker ps`
- List all local images: `docker images`
- Remove an image: `docker rmi <image-id>`
- Remove a container: `docker rm <container-id>`
